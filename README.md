# Whichpokemon

### Whichpokemon is a small app made with Phoenix/Phoenix LiveView.

---

#### Motives to build the app:
- Get more familiar with Elixir/Phoenix
- Practice using new Hex packages (HTTPoison, SurfaceUI)

---

To start the app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
